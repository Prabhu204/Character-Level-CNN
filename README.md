# Character-level-CNN


An implentation of ConvNets using Pytorch based on research paper [Character-level Convolutional Networks for Text
Classification](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5782-character-level-convolutional-networks-for-text-classification.pdf)
 
 The topic classification of the text is a natural language processing.ConvNets were used for extracting infromation 
 from raw signals, ranging from computer vision applications to speech recognition and others.
 Where as, text is considered as a kind of raw signal at character level and applying one-dimensional ConvNets to it.
